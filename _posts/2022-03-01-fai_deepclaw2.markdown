This paper proposes DeepClaw 2.0 as a low-cost, open-sourced data collection platform for learning human manipulation. We developed an intuitive interface that converts the raw sensor data into state-action data for imitation learning problems and further demonstrated our datasetâ€™s potential by using real robotic hardware or a simulated environment.
